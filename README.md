## Silverback Code Library
### How To Use
#### Installation
To use this library most effectively, download the GitHub application for your computer. Once installed you will have the option to *clone* this repository. Clone it to `Documents\Arduino\libraries`. This will allow for easy updates and usage within Arduino.

Once in your libraries folder you can view the example sketches in Arduino through `File -> Examples -> Silverback -> ...`. The examples show how to effectively use each library.

#### Updating
##### Pull an Update
To update your library open the *Git Shell* application and type: *(without the `$`)*  
`$ cd ../Arduino/libraries/Silverback`  
`$ git pull origin master`  
This will reset your library to the most up-to-date version from the online repository and will be ready to use the next time you open Arduino.
##### Push an update
If you have made changes to the repository, like adding a file, or modifying an existing file, you must make a commit and a pull request. Visit [this link](http://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/commandlinegit.html) to learn how to do this with the *Git Shell* command line. You can also do this through the *GitHub App* on [Windows](https://github.com/blog/1969-create-pull-requests-in-github-for-windows) or on [Mac](https://github.com/blog/1946-create-pull-requests-with-github-for-mac).
